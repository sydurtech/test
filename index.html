			<h1>Chest Exercise</h1>
					<br>
					<br>
					<p>If you want to develop deep definition between your pecs, go beyond the bench. Although bench presses are a great way to build size and strength in your chest, they don't activate the inner pectoral muscle fibers nearest the breastbone, which is what you need to do to really get that deep center line. For that, you need to add in exercises in which your arms cross the midline of your body, or at least meet in the center, including cable crossovers and cross-body cable presses.</p>

				<h1>Bicep Exercise</h1>

					<br>
					<p>Find the best moves to make your guns go 'pop,' as chosen by you in our exercise database!
					They may not be the biggest or the strongest group on your body, but your biceps are arguably the best "show" muscles. Upon hearing the clarion cry, "sun's out, guns out," you don't want to flee into the shadows like a vampire with flabby arms. Functionally, the biceps are pretty straightforward—they just flex the elbow—yet humankind has come a long way since the days of hoisting a club. Today, there is a dizzying array of movements to bring out every vein, bulge, and peak. To see the full array, check out the Bodybuilding.com Exercise Database, which hosts video demonstrations of hundreds of exercises with top models from the industry. Below are the top ten biceps exercises as rated by you—our users!</p>

				<h1>Tricep Exercise</h1>
					<br>
					<br>
					<p>Endless curls won’t build you sleeve-busting arms. For super-sized arms, you need to spend less time on your biceps, and devote more time on your triceps. Related: RIPTENSITY: The New Training System From Men’s Health That Can Flatten Your Belly and Strengthen Your Body and Mind “Your triceps comprise more than two-thirds of your upper-arm mass,” says BJ Gaddour, Men’s Health Fitness Advisor. “So building thicker, more developed triceps muscles makes your entire arms look more like shotguns than pistols.”What’s more, says Gaddour, triceps also play a huge role in some of the most effective and popular exercises, like the pushup and bench press. “Triceps strength is usually the limiting factor in pressing movements,” he says. “So your bench, pushup, and other presses only go as far as your triceps take them.”That’s why you need to throw the following seven exercises into your routine. There’s no better way to build gigantic arms—and a bigger bench.</p>
					<br>
					<p>List Of Tricep Exercise:</p>
					<br>
					<ul>
						<li>FOAM ROLLER PRESS.</li>
						<li>CLOSE-GRIP BENCH PRESS.</li>
						<li>ROLLING EZ-BAR TRICEPS EXTENSIONS.</li>

					<h1>Legs Exercise</h1>
					<br>
					<p>What is the true indication of a great physique? Is it large, peaked biceps? Is it razor-sharp abs? Is it bowling-ball shoulders or a wide thick back? None of those are correct. The real answer is, symmetry. A "Symmetrical Physique" is one in which all body parts flow into each other. No one body part or side of the body is bigger than the other.If this is an article about building legs, why am I talking to you about symmetry? I'm getting there. I brought up symmetry because too many beginners skip out on leg-training (or just do a half-ass job of it) and build a horrible imbalance between the size of their upper and lower body. This completely throws off the symmetry of one's physique. There is nothing more ridiculous to see a guy in the gym with a well-developed upper body with toothpick legs.Today you are going to start down a new road, a journey which few make and even fewer survive. The path will be clearly set out before you by the words in this article. The journey will be hard, harder than anything you have ever done before, but once you see the results you will continue this journey of leg training for life. Keep reading ...</p>

						<li>Barbell Deadlift.</li>
						<li>Dumbbell Rear Lunge.</li>

				<h1>Shoulder Exercise</h1>
				<br>
				<p>No two people work out exactly the same. Whether it's choice and sequence of exercises, how many sets to complete of each move, how heavy to go and reps completed, length of rest periods, or advanced training techniques and finishing moves, each lifter has his or her own workout DNA.Among the 9.5 million users of BodySpace, there are probably 9.5 million different shoulder workouts. Individuality can be a good thing, but certain principles make some routines better than others, especially for specific goals. So rather than present you with 9.5 million ways to train your delts—which would make this article slightly time-consuming to read—I've whittled it down to seven really great ones, each with a unique training goal.Pay especially close attention to how exercise choice and order, weight/rep targets, volume, and advanced-training principles can be manipulated to fine-tune a routine for a specific goal. If you find one you like, try it for 4-8 weeks, then go back to your regular workout or try another from the list.</p>
